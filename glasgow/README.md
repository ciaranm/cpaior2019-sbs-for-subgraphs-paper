The Glasgow Subgraph Solver (Modified Version)
==============================================

This is a solver for subgraph isomorphism (induced and non-induced) problems,
based upon a series of papers by subsets of Ciaran McCreesh, Patrick Prosser,
and James Trimble, at the University of Glasgow.

This version of the solver has been modified for a paper on search strategies.
Unless you are trying to reproduce the results in this paper, you are probably
better with the main version:
