Obtain VF3 3.0.3 from the following page:

    http://mivia.unisa.it/datasets-request/

and compile it in a directory named vflib-3.0.3. You will need to modify the
provided Makefile to not compile the 'vf3k' target, since the necessary headers
are not included in the download.

Also compile the helper in this directory, by typing 'make'.
